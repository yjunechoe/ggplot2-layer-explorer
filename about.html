<h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>The <strong>ggplot2 Layer Explorer</strong> is an <a href="https://shiny.posit.co/">R Shiny app</a> that exposes the internal layer-building pipeline of <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/">ggplot2</a>. It is primarily designed as a pedagogical tool, allowing users to <em>see</em> (<strong>inspect</strong>) and <em>touch</em> (<strong>highjack</strong>) a layer’s data as it flows through internal processes. The aim is to help build an intuition for how user-facing code manifests into a plot.</p>
<p>The app makes visible a fundamental concept: <strong>each layer has a corresponding a tabular-data representation which undergoes incremental changes in the internal pipeline</strong>. This idea is formally motivated in the paper <a href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/static/papers/Choe_2022_SublayerGG.pdf">Sub-layer Modularity in the Grammar of Graphics</a> and the companion package <a href="https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace">ggtrace</a> which powers the app. Later sections explain this idea in more detail in the context of the app.</p>
<p>The ggplot2 Layer Explorer is designed by <a href="https://yjunechoe.github.io/">June Choe</a>. It is deployed from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggplot2-layer-explorer">yjunechoe/ggplot2-layer-explorer</a>, where you can also files any <a href="https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggplot2-layer-explorer/issues">issues</a>.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>While ggplot2 is traditionally understood as a visualization system, it can also be viewed as a sophisticated <strong>data wrangling pipeline</strong>. Each layer in a ggplot transforms its data through a series of data operations, from the raw input data to the drawing-ready data (and finally, into the graphical representation).</p>
<p>This data-centric re-imagining of the internals is simplistic yet powerful. The internals-as-data-wrangling model is an effective intermediate-level abstraction because <strong>users of ggplot2 are already experts at reasoning about tabular data</strong> (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr/">dplyr</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table">data.table</a>), something that we take for granted in the R community but is not necessarily true elsewhere. Moreover, many users aspire to develop their own <a href="https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/">extensions</a>; it turns out that conceptualizing extensions as custom data wrangling operations provides <a href="https://evamaerey.github.io/easy-geom-recipes/">the most accessible entry point</a> into becoming an <em>extension developer</em>.</p>
<p>Even for those who are not interested in writing extension packages, learning about the internals can be <em>immediately useful</em> thanks to recent innovations in ggplot2’s <a href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/aes_eval.html">delayed aesthetic evaluation</a> system. The new-ish functions <code>after_stat()</code>, <code>after_scale()</code>, and <code>stage()</code> now give the user unprecedented control of the layer-building pipeline <em>from the outside</em>; this flexibility is unmatched by other implementations of the Grammar of Graphics. This, again, builds on familiar ideas rooted in non-standard evaluation (specifically, <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html">tidy evaluation</a>), which R users are not strangers to (via <code>dplyr::mutate()</code>, the formula <code>~</code> interface, etc.). The app tries to demystify this family of functions: they essentially <strong>schedule <code>mutate()</code> calls on the layer data, to execute later</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>A great number of ggproto objects and methods are involved in the rendering of a ggplot. The app exposes just a subset which meets the following requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Called <em>exactly once</em> per layer</li>
<li>Manipulates the <em>layer data</em> (dataframe in, dataframe out).</li>
</ol>
<p>This excludes some important details like <code>Layout</code> methods and the more granular panel and group methods of <code>Stat$compute_*</code> and <code>Geom$draw_*</code>. The limited scope is intentional - it keeps the UI and the underlying implementation as simple as possible. Motivated users wanting to do more are encouraged to try out <code>ggtrace</code> on their own. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/yjunechoe/ggtrace/issues">ask questions on Github</a> about usage.</p>
<h2 id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>This project would not be possible without the developers of <code>ggplot2</code>. I am indebted to the <a href="https://github.com/ggplot2-extenders/ggplot-extension-club">ggplot2 extenders community</a> for inspiration, feedback, and support.</p>
